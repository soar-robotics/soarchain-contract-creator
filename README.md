# Introduction

We offer a robust framework that streamlines the development of Soarchain smart contracts, serving as a foundational template for creating custom contracts. This repository not only enables you to extend existing code for additional contracts but also alleviates the need to delve into intricate coding details. It houses a collection of essential smart contracts, such as escrow, insurance, and others, integral to the Soarchain ecosystem.

## Development Goals

We try create a powerful tool designed to empower developers in building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Soarchain blockchain using the CosmWasm smart contract platform. With the aim of simplifying and accelerating the development process, this tool provides a user-friendly interface and a set of essential features tailored for creating, deploying, and managing smart contracts on the Cosmos network.
