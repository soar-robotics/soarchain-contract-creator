# Introduction

We provide a resilient framework that simplifies the development of Soarchain smart contracts, acting as a foundational template for crafting customized contracts. This repository not only facilitates the extension of existing code for additional contracts but also eliminates the necessity to delve into intricate coding details. It encompasses a suite of essential smart contracts, including escrow, insurance, and others, crucial to the Soarchain ecosystem.

## Development Goals

We aim to develop a robust tool empowering developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the Soarchain blockchain using the CosmWasm smart contract platform. Our goal is to simplify and expedite the development process by offering a user-friendly interface and a comprehensive set of features specifically designed for creating, deploying, and managing smart contracts on the Cosmos network.
